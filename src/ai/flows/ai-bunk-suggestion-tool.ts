  Consider the following factors:
  - Current grade in the course
  - Total attended classes for the course
  - Student's comfort level with the topic

  Based on these factors, suggest the best course to bunk and provide an accurate estimation of the attendance score drop.

  Here is the student's information:
  Course Name: {{{courseName}}}
  Current Grade: {{{currentGrade}}}
  Total Attended Classes: {{{totalAttendedClasses}}}
  Student Comfort Level: {{{studentComfortability}}}
  Total Classes: {{{totalClasses}}}
  Current Attendance Percentage: {{{attendancePercentage}}}

  Give your recommendation, estimate the attendance drop, and provide a short explanation.
  The suggestedClassToBunk should be the name of the course, and the attendanceScoreDrop should be a number.
