/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed for a local-only application and does not require any security rules.
 * All rules are set to allow nothing, as no data is stored in Firestore.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Not applicable, as no data is stored in Firestore.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * No data is stored in Firestore. All reads and writes are denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Not applicable, as there is no data to authorize.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable, as there is no data to segregate.
